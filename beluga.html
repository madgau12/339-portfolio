        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <P>Belugas are a sociable bunch, often gathering in large numbers, and most of them are chatty as well. 
            Their vocalizations, which include whistles, clicks, and grunts, earned them the nickname “sea canary.” 
            In the summer, different groups of belugas will come together in the relatively warm waters of estuaries 
            and the nearby coastal waters. Beluga mothers seem to find the quiet estuaries ideal for raising their 
            newborns or yearlings—but it’s also a good environment for the belugas to molt. They have extremely thick 
            skin that they shed all at once each summer, often rubbing on the bottom of the estuary to speed the process 
            along. New skin cells grow rapidly.</P>
        
        <p>Once commercially hunted, the much-admired beluga is now a star attraction in the growing ecotourism industry. 
            It‘s also a poster child for ocean conservation. As a top predator, it’s being contaminated by toxic chemicals 
            that are concentrated high in the food chain.</p>

                    <p class="locationP">LOCATION <br> <br>Beluga whales live in the Arctic Ocean and its nearby seas in the Northern Hemisphere. 
                        They are common to many regions of Alaska, as well as Russia, Canada, and Greenland. Belugas are usually found in shallow coastal 
                        waters during the summer months, often in shallow water. </p>

                    <p class="dietP">DIET <br> <br>Beluga whales have a varied diet consisting of octopus, squid, crabs, shrimp, clams, 
                        snails, and sandworms. They also eat a variety of fish, including salmon, eulachon, cod, herring, smelt, and flatfish.</p>

                    <p class="threatsP">THREATS <br> <br>Beluga whale populations are exposed to a variety of stressors and threats, including pollution 
                        (e.g., chemicals, trash), shipping, energy exploration and development, commercial fishing, extreme weather events, strandings, predation 
                        from killer whales and polar bears, underwater noise, subsistence harvesting, and other types of human disturbance.</p>
