        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <P>Narwhals—affectionately known as the “unicorns of the sea”—are very distinctive with their long spiral tusks 
            protruding from their faces. In actual fact, the ivory tusk is the upper left canine of the narwhal, which 
            they use to hit and stun prey. They are beautiful, but you certainly wouldn’t want to get too close to 
            those tusks! </P>
        
        <p>It is predominately the males who have tusks—sometimes two, but sometimes none. Only about 15% of female narwhals 
            have them. The tusks can grow as long as 10 feet and they have significant sensory capabilities, with as many as 
            10 million nerve endings inside. They spend their entire lives in the Arctic waters of Russia, Svalbard, Greenland, 
            and Canada, usually spending up to five months of the year under sea ice around Baffin Bay-Davis Strait. They 
            predominately feed on shrimp, squid, Arctic and polar cod, and Greenland halibut. </p>

                    <p class="locationP">LOCATION <br> <br>Narwhals occur in the Arctic Ocean. They generally occur in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic Ocean, 
                        with few records in the Pacific sector (i.e., western Russia to Alaska to western Canada). Their main distribution in the Arctic Ocean includes from the central Canada 
                        (Peel Sound and northern Hudson Bay) to Greenland to eastern Russia. </p>

                    <p class="dietP">DIET <br> <br>Narwhal’s diet consists of medium to large-size Arctic fish (e.g., Arctic cod, polar cod, and turbot), 
                        squid, and shrimp.</p>

                    <p class="threatsP">THREATS <br> <br>Narwhals are hunted by native peoples of the Arctic for their flesh, blubber, and tusks,
                    have been killed from being entrapped in ice, and Narwhal tissue may contain high levels of contaminants from the environment.
