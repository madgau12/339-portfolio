            <p>Length: 49 to 59 feet
            <br>Lifespan: about 200 years
            <br>Classification: Baleen

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <P>Bowhead whales are second only in size to blue whales. 
            They also have the longest baleen of any whale - the plates reach 5m in length! 
            Living year-round in the Arctic, bowhead whales are predominantly black with the 
            exception of grey/white patches on the front of the lower jaw, and sometimes on the 
            narrow base of the tail. As well as lacking a dorsal fin, bowhead whales have a 
            distinctive double-humped surface profile, an enormous arched upper jaw, and a strongly 
            bowed mouth-line (hence the name).</P>
        
        <p>Bowhead whales are associated with ice floes, which means their movement patterns are
             influenced by the melting and freezing of ice. Their blubber is half a metre thick, 
             which is the thickest found on any mammal. Based on findings from the recovery of 
             stone harpoon heads and the analysis of eye tissue, scientists believe that the bowhead 
             whale may be the longest - living animal in the world - it is possible they can live for more 
             than 100 years - perhaps even up to 200 years.</p>

                <p class="locationP">LOCATION <br> <br>Bowhead whales inhabit the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas, Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin, 
                    Baffin Bay and Davis Strait, the Sea of Okhotsk, and in waters from eastern Greenland and Spitsbergen 
                    to eastern Siberia. The majority spend the winter near the southern limit of the pack ice and move north 
                    as the sea ice breaks up and recedes during spring.</p>

                <p class="dietP">DIET <br> <br>Bowhead whales are baleen whales, so they filter their food by straining huge volumes of 
                    ocean water through their baleen plates (like the teeth of a comb). Bowhead whales have the longest baleen plates of all 
                    whales and feed almost exclusively on marine invertebrates, including small to moderately sized crustaceans, such as 
                    shrimp-like euphausiids (i.e., krill) and copepods. They also ingest other invertebrates and small fish. Scientists estimate 
                    that a bowhead whale needs to eat about 100 metric tons (over 220,000 pounds) of crustaceans per year.</p>

                <p class="threatsP">THREATS <br> <br>Bowhead whale populations are exposed to a variety of human-caused stressors and threats, including:
                    Pollution (e.g., spilled oil, heavy metals, chemicals, debris), Vessel strikes and disturbance, Entanglement in fishing gear, Climate change, Ocean acidification that can affect their prey,
                    and Noise pollution that may affect their feeding, navigation, communication, and ability to detect and avoid predators</p>
